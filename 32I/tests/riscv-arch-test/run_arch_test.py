"""
Runs official riscv-arch-test unprivileged M-extension test files (DIV,
DIVU, MUL, MULH, MULHSU, MULHU, REM, REMU -- see TESTS below) against this
emulator, without the full ACT4 framework (Sail reference model, UDB config,
mise/uv toolchain -- see the conversation this was built in for why that's
out of scope here).

Instead:
  1. Builds the .S file twice against env/riscv_arch_test.h, a hand-written
     stand-in for the framework header that implements only the macros this
     test uses (see that file's docstring for why the full one isn't
     needed/usable here):
       - once normally, for this emulator's own dedicated harness
         (harness.cpp), which halts on this codebase's `j self` idiom and
         dumps the signature memory region;
       - once with -DQEMU_REFERENCE, which makes the *same* test body instead
         write its signature region to stdout via a Linux `write` syscall and
         exit, so it can run standalone under `qemu-riscv32` as a real,
         independently-implemented RISC-V reference.
     (An earlier version of this script hand-computed expected DIV results in
     Python by replaying the register/data-table flow -- that duplicated the
     CPU's own bookkeeping in a second, easy-to-desync way and produced false
     mismatches. Using QEMU as the reference avoids that class of bug.)
  2. Diffs the two signature dumps word-by-word.

Run from anywhere -- paths are resolved relative to this script's location.
